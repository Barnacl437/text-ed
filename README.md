# text-ed
a simple text editor made in Visual Studio/VBasic.NET framework. heavily in development so you can only open files and open a new file.
I made it following various tutorials on the web so I just wanted to share it here to record my work.
if you just want to use something that is not the default Notepad editor or anything else, you can try it. Or not lel


P/S: GitHub says every file they could detect was 100% written in C#, I'm new to this and also for fun so I didn't really know it was.
